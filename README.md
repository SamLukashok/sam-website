# Resume Website

This repository contains a simple React website that displays a college resume. React and ReactDOM are loaded from a CDN, so no build step is required.

## Running the site

1. Install Python (version 3).
2. Start a local server from the root of the repository:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This uses Python's built-in HTTP server to serve the files from the `src` directory on port 3000.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The resume data can be updated in `src/resumeData.js`.
